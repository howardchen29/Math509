        "# Question 1\n",
        "Suppose we invent a new representation for finite precision real numbers based on rational numbers instead of floating point numbers. A rational number is simply the ratio of two integers, and we know how to represent integers on a computer. Rational numbers are dense on the real line, and we can approximate any real number to any desired precision with a rational number. Hence, our data structure is simply two integers, one for the numerator and one for the denominator. Next we need to define arithmetic operations ($+,-,\\cdot, /$). For this to work, our data structure must use only integers and we must define arithmetic operations so that they work only with integers (for example, we cannot assume that we can compute `3.2 + 1.498` because the two numbers are not integers).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let $x = I_1 / I_2$ where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are 16bit integers. Assume for simplicity that $0 \\leq I_1 \\leq I_{\\rm max}$ and $0 < I_2 \\leq I_{\\rm max}$. Hence, each real number represented in finite precision with our new system uses 32bits to store in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "## A\n",
        "There is no point in creating a data structure for finite precision real numbers if we cannot do arithmetic operations with a computer. Devise formulas to perform addition, multiplication, and division that use only arithmetic operations on integers. Arithmetic operations should take as input two numbers in our format and return a single new number also in our format. For example, if $x_1 = I_{11}/I_{21}$ and $x_2 = I_{12}/I_{22}$, then $x_1 + x_2 = x_3$, where $x_3$ is expressed as the ratio of two integers. For each operation, you need to write $x_3$ as the ratio of two integers each of which are functions of the integers $I_{11}, I_{21}, I_{12}, I_{22}$.\n",
